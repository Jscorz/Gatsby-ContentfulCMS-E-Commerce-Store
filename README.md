# Modern Styles | Clothing E-Commerce Store

E-Commerce stores are pretty common now, so I decided to build a clothing e-commerce store front. It is built with Gatsby JS and Contentful CMS for storing the data.

## **How It's Made:**

I started the project with the hello world starter from Gatsby. After installing all the dependencies/packages I built out the Navbar first, followed by the home page building the page layout. I retrieved the data for the products by storing it on Contentful API and then building out graphQL queries to retrieve the data. I used Gatsby Images for most of the images to help with loading times and add a bit of customization to them. I built out the shop page to display all of the products after, the home page only shows featured products. I built out the tags page to let the user cycle through categories of clothing, and built out the contact page after using formspree to store the information to a backend.

## **Tech used:**

HTML, CSS, Javascript, React JS, Gatsby JS, GraphQL, Contentful CMS

---

## **Lesson's learned:**

This was a good project to learn about some of the optimizations that Gatsby JS provides. Gatsby improves upon React app and controls rendering and image-loading times. Gatsby also helps with page-routing. This was also my first project working with Contentful for a backend, so it was interesting learning how to retrieve data from there with GraphQL queries.
